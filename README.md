# Search Engine Project

Collaborators: Emilio Munoz, Tiffany Nguyen, Antonio Flores, Jocelin Macias, Pierre Martinez


## Overview
The `supersearch` program is a custom search engine built to index and query a large collection of financial news articles. It uses an AVL tree-based inverted index to handle documents and metadata efficiently.

### Key Features
- **Interactive User Interface:** Create indices, perform queries, and manage indices.
- **Advanced Queries:** Supports operators like `ORG:` and `PERSON:` for filtering results based on metadata.
- **Relevance Ranking:** Uses term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) and metadata for ranking results.
- **Persistence:** Saves indices to disk for reuse across sessions.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure the following dependencies are installed:
- **C++ Compiler:** GCC or Clang (supporting C++17 or later).
- **JSON Parser:** The project uses [RapidJSON](https://rapidjson.org/), which is included in the template.

### Dataset
- Download the dataset: [US Financial News Articles](https://www.kaggle.com/jeet2016/us-financial-news-articles).
- The dataset contains over 300,000 articles in JSON format. Use the dataset for indexing and testing the program.

## Commands and Arguements

   **Index Creation**
   Create an index for a directory containing JSON files:
   ./supersearch index <directory_with_json_files>

   **Perform a Query**
   Search the indexed data using specific terms:
   ./supersearch query "search terms"

   **Launch the User Interface**
   Start an interactive menu for creating indices, running queries, and managing data:
   ./supersearch ui
