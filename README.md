# Supersearch Project

## Overview
The `supersearch` program is a custom search engine built to index and query a large collection of financial news articles. It uses an AVL tree-based inverted index to handle documents and metadata efficiently.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive User Interface:** Create indices, perform queries, and manage indices.
- **Advanced Queries:** Includes support for operators like `ORG:` and `PERSON:` for filtering results based on metadata.
- **Relevance Ranking:** Uses term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) and metadata for ranking results.
- **Persistence:** Saves indices to disk for reuse across sessions.
