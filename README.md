## Overview
The project involves building a search engine for financial news articles from January to May 2018. The dataset contains over 300,000 JSON-formatted articles. The engine enables users to search for articles based on keywords, organizations, and people, providing ranked results based on relevance.

The system employs a modular object-oriented architecture with key components such as document parsing, indexing, query processing, and a persistence mechanism.
